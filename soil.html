    <h2 style="background-color:black;color:white;" align="center">INTRODUCTION TO SOIL</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="soil.jpeg" class="center">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The soil is defined as the organic and inorganic materials on the earth's surface which provide the medium for the growth of the plants. It slowly develops over time and it is composed of various different materials and it varies due to its composition and structure. It is important for the sustainability of an ecosystem as it serves as the natural medium for vegetation growth. Soil comes under non-renewable resources and its formation is a very slow process.</p>
   <br> <H2 style="background-color:black;color:white;" align="center">TYPES OF SOIL</H2>
    <p>Soil can be categorized into sandy soil, silty soil, clay soil, peaty soil, saline soil, and loam soil. Following are the classifications</p>
    <h2 >SANDY SOIL</h2>
    <img src="sandy.png">
    <P>Among the different types of soil, sandy soil has the largest particles in it. It feels gritty and dry when touched and this is due to the huge spaces present between the particles and also it will not be able to hold water. Rapidly water drains directly to the places where the roots, especially to those seedlings cannot reach. Since they are carried away by the runoff, plants donâ€™t have a chance of using the nutrients present in this soil efficiently. During the spring season, the top side of the sandy soil is light to work with and also warms quickly. 

 

        Moistening the soil and rolling it into a ball in order to check the predominating soil particle are the methods used for testing the soil type. Wet sandy soil when rolled on our palms, there should be no ball formation and it will crumble through our fingers easily. Sandy soil is made up of tiny particles that have been weathered from rocks. It's also deficient in nutrients and water retention, making it one of the worst sorts of soil for farming.</P>
<h2>Features</h2>

        <ul>
    <li>During strong rains, this type of soil is frequently swept away.</li>
    <li>Because it warms up faster, it carries fewer nutrients for the plants.</li>
    <li>This soil is simpler to cultivate and drains and dries quickly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>SILT SOIL:</h2>
<img src="silt.png">
<p>When compared to sandy soil, silty soil will be smaller in size and so it will be smoother and it becomes soapy slick when moistened. Silty soil, when rolled between fingers, leaves dirt on our skin. When opposed to sand, silt has smaller particles. It also contains rock and other mineral fragments. It also holds water better than sand because of its fine texture. It is also good for agriculture due to the above-mentioned properties.

 

    Even though this soil is fertile, it can't hold as many nutrients but it can retain water for a longer period of time. It is cold in nature because of its moisture-retention quality and also it can get compacted easily.
    
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
    <ul><li>If the drainage system is adequately channelized, this provides significant benefits to the plants.</li>
    <li>This soil is easier to cultivate than others.</li>
<li>It has a soapy, silky texture and tends to hold moisture.</li></ul>
</p>

<hr>
<h2>CLAY SOIL:</h2>
<img src="clay.png">
<p>When compared to the above-mentioned soils, clay soil has the smallest particle composition and it has fair water storage qualities. Only a little air can pass through its spaces because of the tiny size of its particles and their tendency to settle together. Plant nutrients will be tightly held due to its slower draining tendency and so this soil is rich in plant food for better growth. clay has the smallest particles. There is extremely little or no airspace since the particles are so closely packed. As a result, water is efficiently retained by this property. However, it becomes difficult for moisture and air to permeate into it, limiting plant growth.

 

    During spring, this soil is cold and it will take time to get warm as the water within the soil should also get warmed. When it gets dry, the downside of the soil will be very heavy to work with. Also, it could turn hard and compact during the summer seasons. It feels sticky, rolls up easily, and forms into a sausage-like Shape if moistened. </p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It is more difficult to cultivate and warms up slowly in the spring.
        </li>
        <li>This soil has a poor ability to drain water and has fewer air gaps.</li>
        <li>When dry, this soil is hard and rocky, but when wet, it becomes sticky and bumpy.</li>
    </ul>
